// include/strata/kernels/cpu/native_expert.hpp - plan v0.3 P6: one routed expert in its GGUF form on the CPU.
//
// The IQ2_XS / IQ3_XXS model files keep their experts in i-quant formats (IQ1_M, IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS, IQ2_S, IQ3_XXS,
// IQ3_S gate/up; Q2_0 or IQ4_NL down) whose values cannot be re-expressed in the Q2_0 pack form.  A native expert
// blob is the three GGUF slices back to back, [gate rows | up rows | down rows], and the arithmetic is ggml-cpu's
// own (`ggml_get_type_traits_cpu`): the activation is quantized with the weight type's `vec_dot_type` and each row
// is one `vec_dot`, exactly what llama.cpp's CPU backend computes for the same tensor.
